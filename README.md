A note on changing your NFTs.
Let's say you don't like the NFT collection you used for testing and got a better idea. You need to be careful here! Whenever you change your collection, you need to follow the same steps from earlier to deploy the NFTs.
Delete the .cache folder that was generated by the Metaplex CLI's candy machine commands.
Change up your NFT files to be whatever you want!
Run Metaplex's upload command via the CLI to upload the NFTs.
Run Metaplex's verify command via the CLI to make sure the NFTs were uploaded.
Run Metaplex's create_candy_machine command via the CLI to create a new candy machine.
Run Metaplex's update_candy_machine command via the CLI to create the drop date.
Update your .env file with all your new addresses.
